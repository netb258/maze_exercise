These are my attempts to solve an interesting programming exercise.

The exercise is to write a program that traverses a maze and gets all paths in the maze.
Also, the program needs to print the shortest path in the maze.

The first attempt is maze.rb, which is in pure Ruby. While programming, it became evident that immutable data structures would really help with the task.

This lead to maze.clj, which is the same program written in Clojure (and using Clojure's immutable data structures).

The third attempt is the maze_hm.rb file. This program uses Ruby's Hamster gem to provide immutable data structures.
